# monos delivery task map

Approved structure: stage → work package → implementation subtask. All newly created records are planning backlog, not approved implementation plans.

## Sequencing

Feasibility gates → Stage A product loop → Stage B capabilities → single-host V1 release. Existing probe evidence is reused; no Stage A/V1 completion is inferred from scaffolding.

## Task tree

## Task sizing and closure

- Stage: milestone and cross-package acceptance; never one bulk implementation assignment.
- Work package: bounded functional outcome, child map and integration acceptance.
- Subtask: one independently reviewable behavior including its necessary failure/recovery tests; may cross schema, backend and UI layers.
- Keep atomic publication and transaction contracts together. Split a leaf when it introduces independently deliverable behaviors or unrelated recovery mechanisms.
- Archive leaves after their evidence and review pass; close packages/stages only after their own integration criteria pass.
- Near-term PostgreSQL, GitHub and command foundation leaves are seeded now. Later packages intentionally await evidence before detailed design and child creation.
- Parent links do not encode execution order: each PRD records upstream gates.
- bootstrap-guidelines remains open and outside this tree. Implementation leaves should update specs with real source/test references as patterns become established; do not mark its examples requirement complete preemptively.

## Coverage

Stage A maps to module-09 steps 1–6 through command foundation, configuration, Discussion, Runtime integration, Task execution, review/correction and integrated acceptance. Stage B maps to second Runtime, serial Nodes, inspection/Replan, parallel worktrees and delivery modes. Release maps to first-run operations and the complete single-host matrix. This index does not supersede module-09 acceptance cases.
