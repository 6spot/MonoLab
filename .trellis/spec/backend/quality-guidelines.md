# Backend Quality Gate

Sources: [Stage A](../../../docs/09-first-executable-slice.md), [readiness](../../../docs/10-architecture-readiness.md), [invariants](../../../docs/08-principles-and-non-goals.md).

## Verification status

The boundary probe has actual scripts in [package.json](../../../package.json): `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm protocol:check`, `pnpm build`, and `pnpm test:db`. Default `pnpm test` deliberately skips the real PostgreSQL suite. On 2026-09-28 the reviewed backend passed 45 unit/schema tests locally and 15 PostgreSQL integration tests in the isolated Node 24/PostgreSQL 17.11 Compose deployment. These tests prove only their asserted probe behavior.

The [Compose README](../../../infra/compose/README.md) describes the private database and real test command. SQL tests create/drop a unique test schema, not production tables or Runner journals. Main-session host evidence owns TLS, Linux processes, real CLI, service restart and reboot claims; no unit test can establish them. Full PostgreSQL multi-worker and authorized GitHub expected-head/merge gates remain separate.

## Rules

The real database entrypoint now includes `postgres.test.ts` (16 cases),
`postgres-claims.test.ts` (6 independent-process cases) and
`postgres-recovery.test.ts` (3 process-crash/settlement cases). All 25 passed on
the pinned Linux PostgreSQL deployment. The regular unit entrypoint skips all
database suites unless `MONOLAB_TEST_DATABASE=1`; use `pnpm test:db` for this gate.

- Test deterministic rules independently of HTTP/Git/Runtime.
- Use fakes for races, then real Linux/CLI/provider probes for external assumptions.
- Validate external payloads and handle result variants exhaustively.
- Never refresh a stale basis automatically to make an action succeed.
- Preserve full collection cardinalities in the single-Node slice.
- Apply the [dependency policy](../index.md); no speculative frameworks.

## High-value tests

Current probe regressions: receipt replay/conflict, atomic rollback/lost reply, capacity reservation, stale connection/credential rejection, event reordering, outbox starvation, complete snapshot pagination with Unicode byte bounds, typed capture repair, and Planner failure state preservation. The table below additionally guides later full-product work; those unimplemented flows are not claimed covered by the probe.

| Boundary | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| Task creation | Different request IDs for one proposal yield one Task |
| Claims/capacity | Workers cannot double-start or oversubscribe |
| Completion/invalidation | Only current evidence unlocks descendants |
| Replan | Changed definitions get new Node IDs; old writers settle |
| Conversation | Atomic reply/watermark, Retry/Withdraw |
| Acceptance | Input first blocks; acceptance first freezes a nonblocking cutoff |
| Delivery | Expected-head guards, uncertain response, partial Retry |
| Limits | Local hard failure BLOCKED; publication finding REVIEW |
| Restart | Outbox/receipt recovery without session memory |

Test observable behavior and races, not private-helper mirroring. Documentation-only work needs link/consistency/format checks rather than an invented runtime suite.

## Review exit

Report executed checks and untested real-host assumptions. The probe does not prove the complete Stage A flow, full multi-worker claims, GitHub delivery or cancellation during admitted finalization. Keep added regressions at their actual boundary instead of declaring external behavior from fake adapters.

Owner command foundation: 51 local unit/schema cases and 32 real PostgreSQL cases
passed on 2026-09-29 (including 7 in `postgres-owner.test.ts`). Full Go race/vet
passed after adapting generated enum references. These checks do not establish
public login, domain action execution or the deferred live Runtime acceptance.
