# Durable selected Attempt dispatch

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Use `apps/server/src/dispatch-queue.ts` for already selected system work awaiting
capacity. Runtime/model selection, Owner Start and semantic context construction
remain owned by later modules. Existing WSS `pending` polling promotes durable
queued rows; memory wakeups are not authoritative.

## 2. Signatures

- `DispatchQueue.enqueue(tx, QueueInput)` returns a stable dispatch ID and persists
  selected context, exact revision basis and canonical input digest.
- `promoteNext(runnerId, connectionInstance, incarnation)` atomically claims one
  eligible queued Attempt and returns its Dispatch, or null when none can run.
- Migration 6: `attempts.state`, `queue_digest`, `end_reason`, one queued owner,
  one Start intent, and `task_runner_locality`.

## 3. Contracts

QUEUED has no process reservation (`process_released=true`, mutation disabled).
It is omitted from Runner inventory and cannot get tool credentials or send Runtime
events. Capacity waiting is normal and does not make Task BLOCKED.

Promotion requires a ready connection owned by the current backend and matching
incarnation, free physical capacity, current Task/revision/activation basis and
settled previous owner. Lock Runner -> one Task -> Attempt. Filter blocked owners
before LIMIT and never hold several Task locks while scanning. Stage A serializes
Node writers within one Task until isolated parallel worktrees are implemented.

Set RUNNING, physical reservation, monotonic owner fence, Node RUNNING and the
single Start outbox row in one transaction. A failure before commit leaves QUEUED;
a lost return after commit recovers the same dispatch/outbox. Replay of enqueue
requires the same full input digest. Do not silently refresh stale queue context:
cancel it with `stale_queue_basis` for the owning module to reconsider.

Pin Task locality on first claim. Other recorded execution hosts require explicit
reconciliation; reject automatic transfer. Stale cancelled queue-only selections
do not establish workspace ownership. Node dependencies require current completed
activation evidence, not merely a COMPLETED label.

Missing formal outcome sets FAILED and admits Stop, retaining capacity until whole
process absence and all operations settle. Completion succeeds only with finalized
result; committed Planner reply succeeds logically while Stop still owns cleanup.
Late started/output/exit records do not revive terminal status or mutation authority.
Event ACKs identify exact sequences; they do not acknowledge missing lower sequences.

## 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Same Attempt ID and input | Same dispatch ID |
| Same Attempt ID, changed input | `payload_conflict` |
| Unknown Runner/Task/Node | `denied_scope` |
| Duplicate queued owner, wrong Task/Node state, missing upstream evidence | `unmet_precondition` |
| Changed enqueue basis | `version_conflict` |
| Unavailable/stale connection, full capacity or unresolved owner | No promotion |
| Queue becomes obsolete | CANCELLED queue row; no Start |
| Unsupported Runner movement | Rejected enqueue or cancelled queue with explicit reason |
| Duplicate/conflicting event | Existing effect / `payload_conflict` |

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

Good: two promotion workers contend for one slot and create one Start. Base: a
backend restart reconnects and retransmits the existing outbox identity. Bad:
terminalizing an Attempt frees capacity before its physical writer disappears.

## 6. Tests Required

`postgres-dispatch.test.ts` verifies queued visibility/identity, concurrent capacity,
independent SIGKILL before/after promotion commit, restart replay, stale queue basis,
late/duplicate events, Stop settlement/fence advancement, locality and dependencies.
Run all real DB suites because fixture admission and existing event/effect handlers
share the migration. No real model is invoked by this verification.

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong: send Start then persist the Attempt, or allocate an in-memory-only queue.
Correct: persist QUEUED, atomically claim and commit the durable Start, then send
through the existing authenticated at-least-once Runner channel.
