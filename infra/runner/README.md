# Isolated Linux Runner installation

Use the [naming and upgrade contract](../../docs/12-product-naming-and-upgrades.md)
before migrating an existing installation. Renamed paths/units do not automatically
migrate recorded process identities, Git worktree paths or service-owned storage.

The bootstrap installs only task-prefixed resources. Review it before running as
root. It intentionally does not install/authenticate OpenCode, start the Runner,
replace Owner configuration, publish Git repositories, or reboot the host.

Prerequisites: Linux cgroup v2, systemd, `git`, Debian `sudo`, the existing `me`
account, OpenCode 1.18.30 at `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/opencode`, and the
explicit zero-cost `opencode/longcat-2.5-preview-free` model. Build needs Go 1.26+
and a C compiler. A task-owned Docker Go build image can provide these without
changing the host toolchain. SQLite is statically compiled by its Go driver.

```sh
# In a native Linux checkout (or task-owned Linux build container):
sh infra/runner/build.sh /tmp/monos-probe-binaries
# After copying the root-owned binaries and reviewing path/account collisions:
sh infra/runner/bootstrap.sh /tmp/monos-probe-binaries --check
sh infra/runner/bootstrap.sh /tmp/monos-probe-binaries
```

Main-session host preparation must provision these files privately:

- `/etc/monos-probe/runner-token`: Runner credential matching the backend;
  mode `0640`, owner `root`, group `monos-probe-read` is **not sufficient**,
  because `me` belongs to that read group. Use owner `monos-probe`, mode `0600`.
- `/etc/monos-probe/ca.pem`: public task CA certificate, mode `0644`.
- `/etc/monos-probe/runner.json`: non-secret settings, mode `0640`, owner
  `monos-probe`; never put a bearer in JSON or an argv.

```json
{
  "endpoint": "https://127.0.0.1:18443",
  "ca_file": "/etc/monos-probe/ca.pem",
  "token_file": "/etc/monos-probe/runner-token",
  "runner_id": "runner-a",
  "journal": "/var/lib/monos-probe/service/journal.sqlite",
  "socket": "/run/monos-probe/command.sock",
  "execution_uid": 1000
}
```

Create a small initialized bare Git fixture as `monos-probe` at
`/var/lib/monos-probe/cache/fixture.git`. Use umask `0027`; the shared read
group makes it execution-readable, while service ownership excludes execution
writes. Do not put credentials in the fixture. Start the unit only after CA,
backend/database and fixture are ready:

```sh
systemctl start monos-probe-runner.service
```

The no-argument sudo policy grants only `monos-probe` the fixed root-owned
helper. The helper rejects unknown JSON fields/actions, limits stdin to 1 MiB,
derives units/paths and fixes the execution identity/properties. Unit control
requires its root-owned retained manifest. The root helper never executes Git or
OpenCode: systemd starts fixed workers as `me`. Ordinary shell commands and
Node filesystem writes remain unrestricted by a product sandbox. Planner
inspection is a service-owned snapshot protected with ordinary Unix ownership.
This is the accepted non-hostile-Agent model; it is not hostile-code containment.

The preflight rejects existing unrelated service/group names, task directories,
unit names, symlinks, writable artifacts and invalid installation markers.
An interrupted first installation is preserved and requires inspection before
retry; the bootstrap never takes ownership of those ambiguous resources.
Reinstallation requires stopped task services and reconciled/unloaded Attempt
and operation units. New execution directories inherit the shared read group
through setgid, while the group has no write access to snapshots or caches.

For a binaries-only update on an existing installation, stop the task Runner
after reconciling its Attempt/operation units and run the same `--check`
preflight. Then install all four rebuilt executables into their existing fixed
paths as root:root `0755`. The Runner and helper must be updated together.
Credentials, launch records, SQLite and workspaces remain in place. An unchanged
unit file does not need `daemon-reload`; start the Runner explicitly afterwards.

Attempt parent directories are explicitly `root:root 0755` after creation;
the service's `0027` umask must not remove execution-account traversal. Existing
parents must already have that exact ownership/mode and are never silently
repaired or reused after an ambiguous failure.

OpenCode runs with `--auto`, native bash/external-directory access and normal
writable HOME/XDG state. Planner's supplied snapshot is protected by service
ownership; its edit-tool denial is supplemental. Interactive questions,
unreviewed native subagents/skills and role switching are excluded from this
single-runtime probe. Main, small, title, summary and compaction models are
explicitly pinned to the selected free model; confirm resolved values on-host.
Retained stdout/stderr have bounded payloads plus one fixed truncation marker
when bytes are actually dropped; reaching the exact limit alone is not a loss.

The first successful workspace opening records its original Git base in the
root-owned operation result before returning the workspace. Duplicate opens
reuse that base. Finalization receives the system-retained base and verifies
both current HEAD and any retained finalization parent descend from it. Orphan
history or a reset before the base produces `invalid_finalization`; missing
objects and unavailable ownership records require recovery. Lost materialization
records are never reconstructed from a convenient current HEAD.

Git commands use a private `0600` temporary protected config for exact directory
exceptions, including linked-worktree metadata. This preserves the scoped
configuration across older Git's upload-pack subprocess without changing the
Owner's global config. System Git requests `core.fsync=committed,reference` and
`core.fsyncMethod=fsync`; controlled restart tests do not establish power-loss
recovery guarantees.

Preserve `/var/lib/monos-probe` after any unresolved run. Cleanup first stops
only units named in retained launch manifests, verifies whole-tree absence,
then stops `monos-probe-runner.service`. Do not delete journals/workspaces,
remove CLI installations, change root's source config, or touch unrelated
units. Removing the sudoers file and disabling the Runner unit removes future
probe launch access; it does not establish that existing writers have stopped.

Root-owned launch records include acknowledgement state; sibling Git operation
cgroups have separate retained `*.operation.json` records. If the helper loses
its systemd acknowledgement, status holds ownership even when a unit is not
visible. A subsequent host boot proves the old process tree absent and permits
the same idempotent operation to reconcile retained Git state. Automatic
same-boot repair of an unacknowledged operation is deliberately not implemented:
inspect the unit/job, cgroup and retained records before any operator repair.
Do not delete that journal merely to make a retry proceed. Well-formed typed
effect failures cross worker/helper JSON boundaries; `capture_hard_limit` is
reserved for proven ENOSPC/EDQUOT during controlled finalization journal writes.

A retained failed Attempt unit, including `200/CHDIR`, is reconciled through
normal status/Stop using its manifest and systemd identity. An unacknowledged
Stop result is replayed from the journal. Disconnecting the control channel
cancels that connection's queued work; reconnect reconciles durable records
before allowing new dispatch.

A formally revoked dispatch that never launched may receive a durable root
tombstone only after confirming no unit, pending job, cgroup or operation record
exists. An existing launch record must use normal status/stop reconciliation.
Tombstones permanently reject delayed Start and never replace a launch journal
to manufacture writer absence.

Real-host cgroup/account, syscall, OpenCode and restart tests remain separate
acceptance evidence. Local Go tests do not establish those facts. A whole-host
reboot requires the Owner's separately agreed window.
